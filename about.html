            <p>
              Silvia Acien is a Spanish Andalusian designer currently studying at Central Saint Martins BA Knitwear course.
</p>
<p>
Acien first came to London in 2017 to attend Kensington and Chelsea’s Level 3 Extended Diploma in Art and Design. It was there that Silvia become amazed by knitwear and the great power of creating her own textiles in order for her to be able to select carefully every technique, fibre and texture.
</p>
<p>
She comes from a rural part of Spain. Growing up at her parents’ farm influenced her way of observing her surroundings. Respecting nature is one of the most important parts of Silvia’s life and she tries to bring this into every piece of clothing she creates, using natural and sustainable elements.
</p>
<p>
After interning at Vivienne Westwood, Charles Jeffrey Loverboy and Maison/0 x LVMH, Silvia started a deeper journey in the regenerative textiles interest, that leads her to keep incorporating innovative fibres into her fashion.
</p>
</p>
<p>
  During her degree, Acien had the chance of being featured in magazines such as Office, FG*K, Malvie, Hunter and Sicky. She also took part in several Fund-raising catwalks, and won the Central Saint Martins Nike project.</p></blockquote>
