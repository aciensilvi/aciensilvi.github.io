            <p>Silvia Acién, the founder of ACIEN, is a Regenerative Knitwear Designer who embodies the essence of regenerative luxury fashion. A graduate of Central Saint Martins' BA Knitwear course in 2023, Silvia draws inspiration from her upbringing in the rural landscapes of Spain, where her connection to her parents' greenhouse instilled in her a deep reverence for nature. This foundational influence has profoundly shaped her worldview and serves as the driving force behind ACIEN's commitment to regeneration. Silvia's ethos is intricately intertwined with her unwavering respect for nature, a principle intricately woven into every crafted garment bearing the ACIEN name.</p>
