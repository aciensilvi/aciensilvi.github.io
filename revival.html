            <p>Silvia Acién is a Regenerative Knitwear Designer, serving as the driving force behind ACIEN—a luxury fashion brand with a commitment to regeneration. A 2023 graduate of Central Saint Martins' BA Knitwear course, Silvia's roots trace back to the rural landscapes of Spain, where her upbringing on her parents' farm profoundly shaped her perspective on the world. Central to Silvia's ethos is a profound respect for nature, seamlessly woven into every garment she crafts, employing natural and regenerative elements.</p>
            <p>In her professional journey, Acién won the prestigious Maison/0 x LVMH Green Trial Award in 2023 and the Frameworks Knitters Award in 2023. Silvia showcased her creations with her fashion brand ACIEN at renowned platforms, including London Fashion Week, Dutch Design Week, Paris Fashion Week, The Future Fabric Expo, and TATE MODERN and was featured in acclaimed publications like The Wall Street Journal, Vogue and Office.</p>
            <p>At the heart of ACIEN lies a profound dedication to preserving traditional techniques, notably a weaving art passed down by Silvia's grandmother three years prior to her passing. This technique utilizes esparto dry branches collected from the Spanish mountains and was traditionally crafted to create baskets to carry eggs and vegetables on the farm. These materials encapsulate Silvia's heritage, and at ACIEN, she works to safeguard them for future generations.

                ACIEN champions biodiversity preservation; All garments and hats are crafted from certified organic yarns, coming from plant-based and wool yarns. A pivotal facet of ACIEN involves collaborations with scientists and bio designers, employing innovative techniques to contribute to water conservation.</p>
            <p>Discovering Gloria during my regenerative journey was an incredibly encouraging encounter. It provided me with the chance to connect with a kindred spirit, an advocate dedicated to amplifying the voices of the most challenging aspects of the fashion industry. This experience is giving me faith in the collective ability to shape a brighter future for our biodiversity. Together, we passionately fight for a common objective – the creation of a regenerative planet.

                Each stitch signifies more than the creation of a garment; it symbolizes a profound connection to our ancestors, community, and the Earth. Through ACIEN collections, we aspire to instill a deeper appreciation for the natural world and underscore the urgency of preserving our heritage for future generations.</p>

            <p>Gloria: “I’m so grateful that Silvia and I discovered each other. Working together has been a seamless and fulfilling process because our values and vision of the future of the fashion industry match perfectly. With this collection we demonstrate that regenerative fashion is possible and we are so excited for the opportunities that are ahead of us!

                My mission is to provide the fashion industry with a wider range of natural yarns, to design innovative blends of fibres that are grown regeneratively, to bridge the existing gap between fashion designers and farming and to make sure that wealth is redistributed across the supply chain. I think that fashion can be a catalyst for positive change when it commits to regenerative business models and when it learns from nature.”</p>
